OpenNoteScanner
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner)

This little application provides a way on scanning handwritten notes and printed documents.

It automatically detect the edge of the paper over a contrastant surface.

When using the [printed special page template](https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner/raw/master/Page%20Templates/A4%20with%202%20pages.pdf) it automatically detects the QR Code printed on the bottom right corner and scans the page immediately.

After the page is detected, it compensates any perspective from the image adjusting it to a 90 degree top view and saves it on a folder on the device.

It is also possible to launch the application from any other application that asks for a picture, just make sure that there is no default application associated with this action.

Requirements
------------

Because of the version of OpenCV that is used in the project it needs to run on Android 5.0 (lollipop) or newer.

In order to capture and manipulate images Open Note Scanner depends on having the OpenCV Manager application installed. If not installed Open Note Scanner will ask to download it from https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenCV-3.1.0-Android or from Google Play Store.


How to Install
--------------

Open Note Scanner is available for simplified installation on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todobom.opennotescanner), from [Amazon App Store](http://www.amazon.com/Claudemir-Todo-Bom-Open-Scanner/dp/B01EUAU924) and also from [F-Droid Android Open Source Repository](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.todobom.opennotescanner).

Binary APK file is available [directly from GitHub in the releases section](https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner/releases) of the project.

### Source code releases

Starting on 1.0.26, small enhancements will be made available only as a source code release. F-Droid should automatically build the source code releases and offer it to installation. Binary releases will be made available on Google Play, Amazon App Store and direct `apk` download from the [releases page](https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner/releases).

Instructions for building
-------------------------

### Android Studio

Import the project from GitHub using File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> GitHub, fill the URL https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner.git

It will ask for a base directory, normally AndroidStudioProjects, you can change it to your preference.

After this the Open Note Scanner can be built.

History
-------

I've started this app on a brazilian holyday "extended weekend" based on the fact that I was unable to find any open source application that does this job. I was mainly inspired on the RocketBook Wave closed source application.

I really do not know if I will extend more the application, but I am writing bellow some objectives to make it better.

Roadmap
-------

* enhance the image gallery of scanned documents
* register a share action in order to obtain documents already pictured through standard camera apps
* implement automatic action based on the RocketBook Wave marking of the page

Donations
---------

My job is on enterprise servers administration and some development consulting. I do collect money from my customers. I am well paid for that.

For being part of open source projects and documenting my work here I really do not charge anything. I am trying to avoid any type of ads also.

If you think that any information you obtained here is worth of some money and are willing to pay for it, feel free to send any amount through paypal or bitcoin, or dogecoin (wow!).
